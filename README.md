#Real Estate Data Analysis Project

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Data Analysis workflow using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) on a real estate dataset.
The dataset contains details about properties such as price, size, location, bedrooms, bathrooms, property type, and listing date.
Through this project, we practice data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and exploratory analysis.
